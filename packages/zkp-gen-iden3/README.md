## Getting Started

### Installing

```
yarn add @rarimo/zkp-gen-iden3
```

### Usage

```ts
import { ZkpGen } from '@rarimo/zkp-gen-iden3'

/**
 * define type with variable to proof,
 * verifiableCredentials response will keep this variable in credentialSubject
 */
type QueryVariableName = { isNatural: number }

const getZkProof = async () => {
  ZkpGen.setConfig({
    // rpc url where statev2 contract is deployed
    RPC_URL: 'https://matic-mumbai.chainstacklabs.com',
    // statev2 contract address
    STATE_V2_ADDRESS: '0x134B1BE34911E39A8397ec6289782989729807a4',
    // api url of issuer svc
    ISSUER_API_URL: 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/',
  })

  const zkProof = new ZkpGen<QueryVariableName>({
    /**
     * In zkp environment, every prove request should have a unique requestId
     * by using this requestId, issuer svc can identify the request
    */
    requestId: '1',
    /**
     * Identity generated by @rarimo/identity-gen-iden3
     */
    identity: identityStoreSnap.identity as Identity,
    /**
     * Verifiable credentials generated by @rarimo/auth-zkp-iden3
     */
    verifiableCredentials:
      verifiableCredentials as VerifiableCredentials<QueryVariableName>,

    /**
     * Challenge is a random string for example user metamask address without '0x'
     */
    challenge: String(provider?.address).substring(2),

    /**
     * Query is a json object with variable to proof
     */
    query: {
      /**
       * variableName is the name of variable to proof
       */
      variableName: 'isNatural',
      /**
       * operator is the operator to compare the variable with value
       */
      operator: ZKP_OPERATORS.EQUALS,
      /**
       * value is the value to compare with variable
       */
      value: ['1'],
    },
  })

  await zkProof.generateProof()

  setIsNaturalProof(zkProof)
}
```
